Thank you for who bought the Onepop client, I really can not forget how much it helped me!
I had several problems with Onepop (leak source old version, leak begin base version by a "dev", fake leaks/fake dumps), but I do not care.
Onepop was such a really good experience to me, not gonna lie... I am considering make a homage for users but I do not know what.
